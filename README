Bonus Features
 - If the user doesn't initially provide a file, the program will prompt them
    to either enter a file name or generate a random list of values (the length
    of which will be entered by the user)
 - The program asks the user if they would like to output the array or not
 - The program will keep track of both the fastest sorting algorithm and
    slowest sorting algorithm for the current run of the program
